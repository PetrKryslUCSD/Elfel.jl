# Solve the Stokes equation of colliding flow

Synopsis: Compute the solution of the Stokes equation of incompressible
viscous flow for a manufactured problem of colliding flow. Hood-Taylor
triangular elements are used.

The manufactured-solution colliding flow example from Elman et al 2014. The
Hood-Taylor formulation with quadratic triangles for the velocity and
continuous pressure on linear triangles.

The formulation is the general elasticity-like scheme with
strain-rate-displacement matrices. It can be manipulated into the one derived
in Reddy, Introduction to the finite element method, 1993. Page 486 ff.

The complete code is in the file [`tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_gen.jl`](tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_gen.jl).

The solution will be defined  within a module in order to eliminate conflicts
with data or functions defined elsewhere.

```julia
module tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_gen
```

We'll need some functionality from linear algebra, static arrays, and the mesh
libraries. Some plotting will be produced to visualize structure of the
stiffness matrix. Finally we will need the `Elfel` functionality.

```julia
using LinearAlgebra
using StaticArrays
using MeshCore.Exports
using MeshSteward.Exports
using Elfel.Exports
using UnicodePlots
```

The boundary value problem is expressed in this weak form
```math
 \int_{V}\underline{\underline{\varepsilon}}(\underline{\delta v})\;
 \underline{\underline{D}}\; \underline{\underline{\varepsilon}}(\underline{u})\; \mathrm{d} V
- \int_{V} \mathrm{div}(\underline{\delta v})\; p\; \mathrm{d} V = 0,\quad \forall \underline{\delta v}
```
```math
 - \int_{V} \delta q\; \mathrm{div}(\underline{u}) \; \mathrm{d} V = 0,\quad \forall \delta q
```
Here ``\underline{\delta v}`` are the test functions in the velocity space,
and ``\delta q`` are the pressure test functions.

```julia
function run()
    mu = 1.0 # dynamic viscosity
```

This is the material-property matrix ``\underline{\underline{D}}``:

```julia
    D = SMatrix{3, 3}(
        [2*mu  0   0
          0  2*mu  0
          0    0   mu])
    A = 1.0 # half of the length of the side of the square
    N = 100 # number of element edges per side of the square
```

These three functions define the true velocity components and the true
pressure.

```julia
    trueux = (x, y) -> 20 * x * y ^ 3
    trueuy = (x, y) -> 5 * x ^ 4 - 5 * y ^ 4
    truep = (x, y) -> 60 * x ^ 2 * y - 20 * y ^ 3
```

Construct the two meshes for the mixed method. They need to support the
velocity and pressure spaces.

```julia
    vmesh, pmesh = genmesh(A, N)
```

Constructive velocity space: it is a vector space with two components. The
degrees of freedom are real numbers (`Float64`). The velocity mesh
carries the finite elements of  the continuity ``H ^1``, i. e. both the
function values and the derivatives are square integrable. Each node
carries 2 degrees of freedom, hence there are two velocity components per
node.

```julia
    Uh = FESpace(Float64, vmesh, FEH1_T6(), 2)
```

Now we apply the boundary conditions at the nodes around the
circumference.

```julia
    locs = geometry(vmesh)
```

We use searching based on the presence of the node within a box. The
entire boundary will be captured within these four boxes, provided we
inflate those boxes with a little tolerance (we can't rely on those
nodes to be precisely at the coordinates given, we need to introduce some
tolerance).

```julia
    boxes = [[-A A -A -A], [-A -A -A A], [A A -A A], [-A A A A]]
    inflate = A / N / 100
    for box in boxes
        vl = vselect(locs; box = box, inflate = inflate)
        for i in vl
```

Remember that all  components of the velocity are known at the
boundary.

```julia
            setebc!(Uh, 0, i, 1, trueux(locs[i]...))
            setebc!(Uh, 0, i, 2, trueuy(locs[i]...))
        end
    end
```

No we construct the pressure space. It is a continuous, piecewise linear
space supported on a mesh of three-node triangles.

```julia
    Ph = FESpace(Float64, pmesh, FEH1_T3(), 1)
```

The pressure in this "enclosed" flow example is only known up to a constant.
By setting  pressure degree of freedom at one node will make the solution
unique.

```julia
    atcenter = vselect(geometry(pmesh); nearestto = [0.0, 0.0])
    setebc!(Ph, 0, atcenter[1], 1, 0.0)
```

Number the degrees of freedom. First all the free degrees of freedom are
numbered, both velocities and pressures. Next all the data degrees of
freedom are numbered, again both for the velocities and for the
pressures.

```julia
    numberdofs!(Uh, Ph)
```

The total number of degrees of freedom is now calculated.

```julia
    tndof = ndofs(Uh) + ndofs(Ph)
```

As is the total number of unknowns.

```julia
    tnunk = nunknowns(Uh) + nunknowns(Ph)
```

Assemble the coefficient matrix.

```julia
    K = assembleK(Uh, Ph, tndof, D)
```

Display the structure of the indefinite stiffness matrix. Note that this is the complete matrix, including rows and columns for all the degrees of freedom, unknown and known.

```julia
    p = spy(K, canvas = DotCanvas)
    display(p)
```

Solve the linear algebraic system. First construct system vector of all
the degrees of freedom, in the first `tnunk` rows that corresponds to the
unknowns, and the subsequent rows are for the data degrees of freedom.

```julia
    U = fill(0.0, tndof)
    gathersysvec!(U, [Uh, Ph])
```

Note that  the vector `U` consists of nonzero numbers in rows are for the
data degrees of freedom. Multiplying the stiffness matrix with this
vector will generate a load vector  on the right-hand side. Otherwise there is no loading, hence the vector `F` consists of all zeros.

```julia
    F = fill(0.0, tndof)
    solve!(U, K, F, tnunk)
```

Once we have solved the system of linear equations, we can distribute the
solution from the vector `U` into the finite element spaces.

```julia
    scattersysvec!([Uh, Ph], U)
```

Given that the solution is manufactured, that is exactly known, we can
calculate the true errors.

```julia
    @show ep = evaluate_pressure_error(Ph, truep)
    @show ev = evaluate_velocity_error(Uh, trueux, trueuy)
```

Postprocessing. First we make attributes, scalar nodal attributes,
associated with the meshes for the pressures and the velocity.

```julia
    makeattribute(Ph, "p", 1)
    makeattribute(Uh, "ux", 1)
    makeattribute(Uh, "uy", 2)
```

The pressure and the velocity components are then written out into two VTK
files.

```julia
    vtkwrite("tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_gen-p", baseincrel(pmesh), [(name = "p",), ])
    vtkwrite("tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_gen-v", baseincrel(vmesh), [(name = "ux",), (name = "uy",)])
```

The  method converges very well, but, why not, here is the true pressure
written out into a VTK file as well. We create a synthetic attribute by
evaluating the true pressure at the locations of the nodes  of the
pressure mesh.

```julia
    geom = geometry(Ph.mesh)
    ir = baseincrel(Ph.mesh)
    ir.right.attributes["pt"] = VecAttrib([truep(geom[i]...) for i in 1:length(geom)])
    vtkwrite("tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_gen-pt", baseincrel(pmesh), [(name = "pt",), ])

    return true
end

function genmesh(A, N)
```

Hood-Taylor pair of meshes is needed. The first mesh is for the
velocities, composed of six-node triangles.

```julia
    vmesh = attach!(Mesh(), T6block(2 * A, 2 * A, N, N), "velocity")
```

Now translate so that the center of the square is at the origin of the
coordinates.

```julia
    ir = baseincrel(vmesh)
    transform(ir, x -> x .- A)
```

The second mesh is used for the pressures, and it is composed of
three-node triangles such that the corner nodes are shared between the
first and the second mesh.

```julia
    pmesh = attach!(Mesh(), T6toT3(baseincrel(vmesh, "velocity")), "pressure")
```

Return the pair of meshes

```julia
    return vmesh, pmesh
end
