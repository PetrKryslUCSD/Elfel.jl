# Elfel Documentation

Elfel provides support for the development of Finite Element Method applications, especially in the area of continuum mechanics. Mixed methods with cooperating finite element spaces are supported. High performance is one of the focus points.

The design of this package is predicated on the notion that it will provide simple building blocks  to  those who wish to explore the internals of finite element methods.  Hence the focus is on low-level building blocks rather than on prepackaged, high-level, functionality.
