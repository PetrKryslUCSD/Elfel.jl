# # Solve the Stokes equation of colliding flow: vector Laplacian version

# Synopsis: Compute the solution of the Stokes equation of two-dimensional
# incompressible viscous flow for a manufactured problem of colliding flow.
# Hood-Taylor triangular elements are used.

# The "manufactured" colliding flow example from Elman et al 2014. The
# Hood-Taylor formulation with quadratic triangles for the velocity and
# continuous pressure on linear triangles. 

# The pressure is shown here with contours, and the velocities visualized with
# arrows at random points.
# ![Pressure and velocity](colliding.png)

# The formulation is the one derived in Reddy, Introduction to the finite
# element method, 1993. Page 486 ff.

# The complete code is in the file [`tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_reddy.jl`](tut_stokes_ht_p2_p1_reddy.jl).

# The solution will be defined  within a module in order to eliminate conflicts
# with data or functions defined elsewhere.

# We'll need some functionality from linear algebra, static arrays, and the mesh
# libraries. Some plotting will be produced to visualize structure of the
# stiffness matrix. Finally we will need the `Elfel` functionality.
