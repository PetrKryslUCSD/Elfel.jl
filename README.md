# Elfel.jl: Extensible library for finite element methods

**elfel**<br>
G. *adjective*. different, like something else, unique, unparalled

## Introduction

This package provides support for the development of Finite Element Method applications, especially in continuum mechanics. Mixed methods with cooperating finite element spaces are supported. High performance is one of the focus points.

## Dependencies

The library relies on mesh support from the following suite of small mesh-management packages:
```
github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/MeshCore.jl
github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/MeshSteward.jl     
```

## News

- 07/05/2020: Vector finite element spaces tested.
- 06/26/2020: L2 elements  implemented, Stokes problem example.
- 06/19/2020: Example of a mixed method for the discrete Stokes problem added.
- 05/25/2020: Firmed up the concept of iterators for access to element and quadrature point data.


## Usage

Clone the repository, and execute
```
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()
```
in the `Elfel` folder.

The `examples` folder can be explored by simply running the files with `include`.
